# Zenith Keyboard

ZMK firmware configuration for the Zenith.

Zenith is cool 6 columns version of the the TOTEM split keyboard, designed by the people at [ergo mech shop](https://ergomech.store/)

The controllers are the Seeeduino XIAO BLE (nRF52840) - I had no trouble pairing the halves with MacOS M series, Windows 11, and Arch Linux.
